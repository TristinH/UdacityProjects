<h3>Project Portfolio</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
The goal of this project was to take a PDF mockup and transform it into HTML. The layout of the mockup had to be matched as close as 
possible while providing unique images and text. Additionally, the page had to be responsive when viewed on a tablet or mobile phone 
screen.

<h3>Multi User Blog</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
A fully functional blog with the ability to support many users. Users can make posts that are updated to the main page. Other users can 
view those posts, like/unlike the posts, and create comments. Users can create accounts with a username and password. They can edit and delete their own posts. Passwords are stored securely with hashing and salting and any forms are checked for authorization before being processed. User sessions are tracked with the use of a secure cookie that is a hash of the user's id and a secret string.
