This Repo contains the links to all the individual projects I completed for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

<h3>Project Portfolio</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
A simple web page exhibiting a few of the other projects. The goal of this project was to take a PDF mockup and transform it into HTML. 
The layout of the mockup had to be matched as close as possible while providing unique images and text. Additionally, the page had to be 
responsive when viewed on a tablet or mobile phone 
screen.

<h3>Multi User Blog</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
A fully functional blog with the ability to support many users. Users can make posts that are updated to the main page. Other users can 
view those posts, like/unlike the posts, and create comments. Users can create accounts with a username and password. They can edit and 
delete their own posts. Passwords are stored securely with hashing and salting and any forms are checked for authorization before being 
processed. User sessions are tracked with the use of a secure cookie that is a hash of the user's id and a secret string.

<h3>Tournament Database Schema</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
A database API to allow one to easily implement a swiss tournament bracket. The main purpose was to design a database schema that stored 
a player's standings in a swiss bracket after each round. The schema is presented in the form of an SQL file that can be used to create 
the database to use in an application. Additionally, there is a python utility class included that abstracts away many of the tasks one 
would need to run a swiss tournament such as checking player standings and matching players for a round.

<h3>Item Catalog</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
A simple web application with complete CRUD functionality and user authentication with OAuth 2. The goal was to make a web application 
that could interact with a database to create a catalog for certain items that are broken up into categories. Users have the ability to 
perform all the major database operations (create, read, update, and delete) on categories or items they enter. Users are authenticated 
with Google's OAuth 2 service. Authorization is considered prior to any alteration to the database.
