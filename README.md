<h3>Project Portfolio</h3>
<h6>Description</h6>
The goal of this project was to take a PDF mockup and transform it into HTML. The layout of the mockup had to be matched as close as possible while providing unique images and text. Additionally, the page had to be responsive when viewed on a tablet or mobile phone screen.
